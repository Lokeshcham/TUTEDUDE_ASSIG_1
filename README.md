## Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Performs the following mathematical operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

### Code Explanation
1. **Taking Input:**
   - The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
   - These inputs are converted to floating-point numbers to handle both integers and decimals.

2. **Performing Operations:**
   - The four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are performed.
   - The division operation includes a check to avoid division by zero.

3. **Displaying Results:**
   - The results are displayed using formatted strings for better readability.

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. The program will perform the calculations and display the results.

### Example Output
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15.0
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5.0
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50.0
Division: 10 / 5 = 2.0
```

### Code Explanation
1. **Taking Input:**
   - The program prompts the user to enter their first and last name.

2. **Concatenating Names:**
   - The first and last names are combined with a space in between to create a full name.

3. **Displaying Greeting:**
   - A personalized greeting message is displayed using an f-string for better readability.

### Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter your first and last name when prompted.
3. The program will generate a personalized greeting message.

### Example Output
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome!
```
